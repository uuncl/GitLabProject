My career goals and future plans:

I aspire to develop my programming and web development skills and gain practical experience through projects and collaborative training. I aim to work for a technology company that fosters continuous learning and challenges me to solve problems and build real-world solutions for users.

In the long term, I aspire to become a professional developer who contributes to the development of useful systems and applications, and perhaps even works on my own project or launches an application that serves the community. I will focus on improving my English, learning new programming technologies and tools, and attending courses and workshops that support my career path.
